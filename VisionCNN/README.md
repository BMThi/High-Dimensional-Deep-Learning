# 5MA-HDDL - VisionCNN
## Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision

This tutorial uses the "wildlife" **dataset**. 
- If your workstation allows it, and if you are working locally, this dataset is available in the eponymous folder (which you have already downloaded by cloning the present repository). 

- Otherwise, you can easily download it with the following command.
```
git clone https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/chevallier-teaching/datasets/wildlife.git
```
