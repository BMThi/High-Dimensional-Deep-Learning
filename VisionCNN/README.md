# 5MA-HDDL - VisionCNN
## Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision

This tutorial uses the "wildlife" _dataset_. 
- If your workstation allows it, and if you are working locally, this dataset is available in the eponymous folder (which you have already downloaded by cloning the present repository). 

- Otherwise, you can easily download it with the following command.
```
!git clone https://plmlab.math.cnrs.fr/chevallier-teaching/datasets/wildlife.git
```

To download solutions to collab, run the command:
```
!wget --recursive --no-check-certificate 'https://plmbox.math.cnrs.fr/d/7d9464fc90634b1280c4/?dl=1'
```
