# 5MA-HDDL - Image Classification
## Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

---

This tutorial is in two parts.
<br><br>

#### [MNIST](MNIST.ipynb) - Handling Convolutional Neural Networks

In this tutorial you will learn to : 
* Write multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with [`Keras`](https://keras.io/) and [`Tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* Understand how $\texttt{convolutional}$, $\texttt{max pooling}$, $\texttt{stride}$ and $\texttt{padding}$ layers work.
* Use these models for image classification.
