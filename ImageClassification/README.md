# 5MA-HDDL - Image Classification
## Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks


This tutorial is in two parts.
<br><br>

#### [MNIST](MNIST.ipynb) - Handling Convolutional Neural Networks

In this tutorial, you will learn to: 
* Write multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with [`Keras`](https://keras.io/) and [`Tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* Understand how $\texttt{convolutional}$, $\texttt{max pooling}$, $\texttt{stride}$ and $\texttt{padding}$ layers work
* Use these models for image classification

<br>

#### [Cats-vs-Dogs](Cats-vs-Dogs.ipynb) - Image classification models in a data-poor context

In this tutorial, you will learn to:
* Use convolutional networks to  build image classifiers on color images
* Use pre-trained models ($\texttt{VGG}$, $\texttt{Inception}$, _etc._) to improve the accuracy of the results
* Fine-Tuned pre-trained models
